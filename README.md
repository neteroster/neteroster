Hello!

I'm **NeterOster**, a student studying in School of Mathematical Science, South China Normal University (SCNU).

## I love...

* I enjoy **learning maths**, especially analysis. But I have only a little knowledge of maths. I'd love to learn more!
* I enjoy **coding**. However, I havn't yet leart it systematically. But I'm now learning more in my school.

## I also love...

* I'm a **GalGame Player**! I enjoy sinking myself into a super-long story, listening to beautiful OSTs, appreciating wonderful drawing, and most importantly, discovering some emotions that I've never felt before, or recalling some emotions that I've decided not to forget.
* I'm an ACGN music lover. I listen ACGN music of all kinds and some of them are my favourite.

## I'm learning...

* I'm learning maths and coding in my school.
* I'm teaching myself Japanese, one of the most beautiful languages I've ever heard. To me, Japanese is a way to convey emotions.

## My Vision

* I want to challenge myself more and more! I've made a promise to myself, not to stop chasing what I love and continue to challenging myself no matter what happened.
